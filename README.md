# Udacity_Capstone_Project

Sure, let's structure the project to meet the given criteria.

### Project Overview

#### Background Information
**Problem Domain**: Education
**Project Origin**: The project aims to utilize the College Scorecard data provided by the U.S. Department of Education. This dataset contains comprehensive information about U.S. colleges and universities, including various attributes like tuition costs, graduation rates, student demographics, and more.
**Data Sets**: The primary dataset for this project will be the College Scorecard data, which can be downloaded from the [U.S. Department of Educationâ€™s College Scorecard website](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/).

### Problem Statement

#### Problem Definition
The objective of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to better understand educational outcomes by answering the following questions:
1. **What university-level factors predict the presence of a strong retention and graduation rate?**
2. **What financial factors most significantly impact student loan default rates at universities?**
3. **How do student demographics influence graduation rates and post-graduation salaries?**

#### Strategy for Solving the Problem
To address these questions, we will:
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Download and clean the College Scorecard dataset to ensure it is suitable for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA to understand the distribution of data and identify potential features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features if necessary and preprocess the data for model training.
4. **Model Building and Evaluation**: Use appropriate machine learning algorithms to build predictive models. Evaluate these models using suitable metrics.
5. **Interpretation and Presentation**: Analyze the results to draw meaningful insights and present the findings effectively through visualizations and reports.

### Metrics

#### Metrics for Model Performance
We will use the following metrics to measure the performance of our models, based on the characteristics of each problem:

1. **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances. This metric is straightforward and gives an overall measure of model performance. It is particularly useful when the classes are balanced.

2. **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**:
   - **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. It measures the accuracy of the positive predictions.
   - **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the actual positives. It measures the ability of the model to identify all relevant instances.
   - **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall. It is particularly useful when the classes are imbalanced, providing a single metric that balances both precision and recall.

For the classification problems, such as predicting loan default rates or graduation rates:
- **Accuracy**: To measure the overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision and Recall**: To understand the performance on predicting specific classes, particularly important in imbalanced datasets.
- **F1-Score**: To provide a balanced measure of precision and recall, especially useful if the cost of false positives and false negatives are different.

For regression problems, such as predicting post-graduation salaries:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: To measure the average magnitude of errors in predictions.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: To measure the average squared difference between actual and predicted values, giving more weight to larger errors.
- **R-squared**: To provide the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

### Project Steps

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**:
   - Download the College Scorecard dataset.
   - Handle missing values and remove duplicates.
   - Standardize data formats.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize data distributions and relationships between features and target variables.
   - Identify potential key factors and features.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new features if necessary.
   - Normalize or scale features for model training.

4. **Model Building and Evaluation**:
   - Split the data into training and test sets.
   - Train models using appropriate algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forest).
   - Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, MAE, MSE, and R-squared as applicable.

5. **Interpretation and Presentation**:
   - Analyze model predictions to draw insights.
   - Create visualizations and reports to present findings.
